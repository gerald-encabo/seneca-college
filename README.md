## Seneca College

Seneca College's main page, which I have work during my co-op and contract during a work experience with Seneca. I have worked using programming/languages such as HTML, CSS, JQuery & Bootstrap, which it has used in components. I have also work with Content Management system (CMS) using OpenCms and Adobe Experience Manager (AEM), which the technology platform used to deploy the web pages. Google Technology such as Analytics, Maps API, and Font API is something I have used for tracking website traffic, displaying Seneca Campuses maps, and importing new fonts which have been used as standard font family throughout the website. Technology SiteImprove was every day used for performing quality assurance to fix issues bugs, broken links, past dates, and typographical errors. While, Adobe Photoshop was used for cropping and compressing the size of images for web page peformance.AODA or Accessibility for Ontarians with Disabilities Act is the guideline used when creating web pages to make sure the Seneca College deliver a responsive website that everyone can access all the information across the website regardless of personability.
